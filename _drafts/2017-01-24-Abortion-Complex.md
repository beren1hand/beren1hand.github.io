"The Abortion Issue" is not *an* issue. It is a tangled nest of interconnected issues, moral and legal.

1. Whether or not the fetus has a right to life.
2. How the fetus' rights interact with the rights of the woman.
3. Whether or not an exhaustive discussion of rights is sufficient to settle the moral question.
4. When it is appropriate to use the power of the State to prevent someone from doing a thing that is morally wrong.
5. When it is appropriate to coerce someone into performing, participating in, or paying for an action they believe is morally wrong.

Every one of these questions is painfully difficult to resolve. If you believe there is a single set of answers that all reasonable people of decent moral character must agree on, you are wrong.

I'm not saying we should stop debating. We must keep debating.

But just as you want people to tolerate your own controversial beliefs on at least one of these questions, you need to tolerate some controversial beliefs on the other ones.

Practically, this implies that our public policy should look like a compromise. One that satisfies nobody completely and as many people as possible to the greatest degree possible.

I have my own views on what that compromise should look like. I'm sure you have yours. Let's try to listen a bit more carefully as we work this out.
