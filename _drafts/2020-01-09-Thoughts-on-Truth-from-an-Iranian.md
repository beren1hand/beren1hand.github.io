# Some Context

Many of you have noticed that I have been much louder than usual over the past
several days regarding my criticism of President Trump. It's no secret that I
have always been opposed to Trump as a politician, but the events of this past
weekend were, in my view, of a radically different kind. This post is my attempt
to clarify what changed.

# Just War Theory

I am a staunch advocate of
[Just War Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/).
Tons of great resources are available online that explain the basics, but I will
summarize just a few key points here.

In brief, Just War Theory states that there are times when it is morally
permissible to fight a war, but there are stringent rules in place that govern
**when** and **how** war may be fought.

### Ethics and/or International Law

One thing I should note is that I am an ethicist, not a lawyer. These are
fundamentally different, though related, fields. For example, the moral
wrongness of slavery provides reasons to make laws against slavery, but slavery
would be morally wrong even if there were no law against it. I will be
approaching Just War Theory primarily as a view in ethics, though it will be
important to discuss some laws along the way.

### When War is Allowed (*Jus Ad Bellum*, Just Cause for War)

In order to have
[Just Cause](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/#JusAdBell),
a war must be undertaken:

- For the right kinds of reasons
- Proportionally to what is at stake
- As a last resort
- By a legitimate authority

### How to Fight a War (*Jus in Bello*, Just Means of Warfare)

In order for a war to be fought with
[Just Means](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/#JusBell), it must:

- Never intentionally target non-combatants
- Kill and/or destroy only as necessary
- Kill and/or destroy only proportional to what is at stake

# Trump vs Iran (January 2020)

With Just War Theory (JWT) in scope, let us consider two questions.

## Question 1: Was Trump justified in killing General Soleimani?

**Maybe. (But probably not.)**

There is no doubt that if we were already at war with Iran, General Soleimani
would (at least in principle) count as a legitimate military target. But, thankfully,  we are not (yet) at war with Iran. Let's see if we have Just Cause:

### 1. War must be undertaken for the right kinds of reasons

Historically, JWT allowed for only one legitimate reason: self-defense.

That justification was naturally extended to the defense of allies who were
defending themselves, but **only if an attack had already occurred**. It was
never permitted to start a war, only to recognize that one had been started.

More recently, Just War theorists have tended to allow the justification of
pre-emptive strikes. The main reason for this shift was the rise of **weapons of
mass destruction (WMDs)**. Especially when facing the threat of nuclear
annihilation, one can see how prevention would be the only satisfying form of
self-defense.

But this is dangerous territory. Pre-emption requires knowledge of the future,
and that is hard to come by. The Iraq War began in 2003 (with bi-partisan
Congressional support) under the justification that Saddam Hussein possessed  
WMDs. History has shown that he did not. If this was an honest mistake, then
the Iraq War can be thought of as an accidental moral lapse. If we should have
known better (which most scholars now believe), then we started a war without
Just Cause.

Trump has justified the Soleimani killing as a pre-emptive strike to prevent an
immanent attack on US citizens. We don't yet know enough to determine if the
evidence for this was sufficient. To date, no sufficient evidence has been
offered, and there are warning signs that Trump acted impulsively with nothing
close to sufficient evidence. Time will tell.

### 2. War must be undertaken proportionally to what is at stake

Essentially, the costs of a war must be justified by its benefits. We must not
undertake courses of action that will end many thousands, millions, or even
billions of lives except to prevent some comparable evil.

**This strikes me as the strongest objection to the Soleimani killing.**

I'm aware that many people (including Iranians like the author of
[this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/1C888mSyD7s)),
are happy that Soleimani is dead. That happiness might be justified in any
number of ways. I honestly don't know enough about Iran to say.

However, the US cannot take out every bad military or political leader, even
if a substantial percentage of the people under their influence would rather see
them removed.

The painfully obvious parallel is the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It
seemed like a good idea at the time, and was widely celebrated by Iraqis. But
time has shown that those actions have led to near constant political
instability and the rise of the Islamic State (aka ISIS).

### 3. War must be undertaken as a last resort

I can see no reason to believe that Trump had exhausted all other plausibly
fruitful courses of action prior to killing Soleimani, an act which
dramatically escalated the situation and could easily have lead to war.

### 4. War must be undertaken by a legitimate authority

Trump does have legal standing to undertake small-scale military actions without
Congressional approval. However, the significance and danger of this particular
action make it preferable that he obtain more support than he did.

Furthermore, the fact that so many of our global allies have condemned the
killing undermines his authority in this case. The President's military actions
should always be undertaken with the understanding that they will be agreeable
to our allies, even if we do not consult them first. Trump had no good reason to
believe this.

### Did Trump have Just Cause?

**Probably not.** If there really was strong evidence of a very serious, immanent
attack, then maybe. But given the posturing we've seen from the Trump
administration over the last few days, that seems extremely unlikely.

# Question 2: Did President Trump commit an act of terrorism on Twitter?

**Yes.**

I understand that my claim here will strike some as ludicrous.



Trump's recent actions demonstrate little to no concern for critical constraints
on the methods of warfare.






In my view, this fundamentally disqualifies him as a
morally or politically legitimate leader, and renders any further political
support of him to be morally illegitimate.
