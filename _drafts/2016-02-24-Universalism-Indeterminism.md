With William Lane Craig coming to town, I'm in the mood for some philosophy of religion.

Here's a sketch of an argument that I find compelling.

If (as is normal for people of a certain theological persuasion) one accepts all of the following:
```
1. God exists. (Classical Theism)
2. God fully determines the destiny of every person. (Theological Determinism)
3. Salvation (whatever that entails) is good for a person, among the very greatest of goods, in fact.
4. Loving someone entails doing what is best for them, insomuch as that is possible given existing constraints.
```

Then one must choose between the following beliefs (i.e. one cannot have both):

```
A. All people will eventually be saved. (Universalism)
B. God does not love everyone. (For lack of a better term, I'll call this Divine Indifference)
```

For now, at least, I'm going to take 1, 3, and 4 for granted. 1 because otherwise there's nothing to talk about. 3 and 4 because they strike me as obviously correct.

Thus, if the argument works, then here are your options:

```
I. Theological Determinism and Universalism
II. Theological Determinism and Divine Indifference
III. Theological Indeterminism
```

Once upon a time, I was committed to III. I am now open to both III and I.

II strikes me as incompatible with Divine Perfection. It is thus incompatible with Classical Theism and should be rejected.

Therefore, it's Universalism or Indeterminism (or both).
