In these last two weeks, you might be wondering, "What's the best way to get someone caught up on Star Wars before The Last Jedi release?" Here are some recommendations:

## 1) The Short Route: IV, V, VI, VII

The bare essentials. This one works for everyone, beginners and old-timers alike.

## 2a) The Preferred Route for Old-Timers: R1, IV, V, VI, VII

Rogue One is marvelous. Include it if you can.

## 2b) The Preferred Route for Newbs: IV, V, VI, R1, VII

Rogue One is built entirely out of references to the Original Trilogy. You just can't watch it first unless you are already saturated in the lore.

## 3) The Prequels-Included Route: IV, V, I, II, III, VI, R1, VII

The Prequels are just nowhere near as good as anything that has come out before or after them. But they have their moments. That being said, they totally screw up the most important dramatic elements of the original trilogy. This viewing order maximizes the dramatic impact of each film.

## 4) The "Ok, fine. Watch them in order of fictional chronology" Route: I, II, The Clone Wars, III, Rebels, R1, IV, V, VI, VII
If you absolutely insist on watching them in the order of portrayed events, go all the frikkin' way and watch both animated series. Clone Wars and Rebels are worthy additions to the canon. Better than any of the Prequels.


## A helpful key for the uninitiated:
- IV - A New Hope, 1977
- V - The Empire Strikes Back, 1980
- VI - Return of the Jedi, 1983
- I - The Phantom Menace, 1999
- II - Attack of the Clones, 2002
- III - Revenge of the Sith, 2005
- VII - The Force Awakens, 2015
- R1 - Rogue One, 2016
- Clone Wars, 2008 to 2015
- Rebels, 2014 to Present
