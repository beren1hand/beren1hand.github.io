# Some Context

Many of you have noticed that I have been much louder than usual over the past
week regarding my criticism of President Trump. It's no secret that I
have always been opposed to Trump as a politician, but the events of last
weekend were, in my view, of a radically different kind. This post is my attempt
to clarify what changed.

# Just War Theory

I am a staunch advocate of
[Just War Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/).
Tons of great resources are available online that explain the basics, but I will
summarize just a few key points here.

In brief, Just War Theory states that there are times when it is morally
permissible to fight a war, but there are stringent rules in place that govern
**when** and **how** war may be fought.


### When War is Allowed (*Jus Ad Bellum*, Just Cause for War)

In order to have
[Just Cause](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/#JusAdBell),
a war must be undertaken:

- For the right kinds of reasons
- Proportionally to what is at stake
- As a last resort
- By a legitimate authority


### How to Fight a War (*Jus in Bello*, Just Means of Warfare)

In order for a war to be fought with
[Just Means](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/#JusBell), it must:

- Never intentionally target non-combatants
- Kill and/or destroy only as necessary
- Kill and/or destroy only proportional to what is at stake

# Trump vs Iran (January 2020)

With Just War Theory (JWT) in scope, let us consider two questions.

## Question 1: Was Trump justified in killing General Soleimani?

**Maybe. (But probably not.)**

There is no doubt that if we were already at war with Iran, General Soleimani
would (at least in principle) count as a legitimate military target. But,
thankfully,  we are not (yet) at war with Iran.

Let's see if we can establish Just Cause:

### 1. War must be undertaken for the right kinds of reasons

Historically, JWT allowed for only one legitimate reason: self-defense.

That justification was naturally extended to the defense of allies who were
defending themselves, but **only if an attack had already occurred**. It was
never permitted to start a war, only to recognize that one had been started.

More recently, Just War theorists have tended to allow the justification of
pre-emptive strikes. The main reason for this shift was the rise of **weapons of
mass destruction (WMDs)**. Especially when facing the threat of nuclear
annihilation, one can see how prevention would be the only satisfying form of
self-defense.

But this is dangerous territory. Pre-emption requires knowledge of the future,
and that is hard to come by. The Iraq War began in 2003 (with bi-partisan
Congressional support) under the justification that Saddam Hussein possessed
WMDs. History has shown that he did not. If this was an honest mistake, then
the Iraq War can be thought of as an accidental moral lapse. If we should have
known better (which most scholars now believe), then we started a war without
Just Cause.

Trump has justified the Soleimani killing as a pre-emptive strike to prevent an
immanent attack on US citizens. We don't yet know enough to determine if the
evidence for this was sufficient. To date, no sufficient evidence has been
offered, and there are warning signs that Trump acted impulsively with nothing
close to sufficient evidence. Time will tell.

### 2. War must be undertaken proportionally to what is at stake

Essentially, the costs of a war must be justified by its benefits. We must not
undertake courses of action that will end many thousands, millions, or even
billions of lives except to prevent some comparable evil.

**This strikes me as the strongest objection to the Soleimani killing.**

I'm aware that many people (including Iranians like the author of
[this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/1C888mSyD7s)),
are happy that Soleimani is dead. That happiness might be justified in any
number of ways. I honestly don't know enough about Iran to say.

However, the US cannot take out every bad military or political leader, even
if a substantial percentage of the people under their influence would rather see
them removed.

The painfully obvious parallel is the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. It
seemed like a good idea at the time, and was widely celebrated by Iraqis. But
time has shown that those actions have led to near constant political
instability and the rise of the Islamic State (aka ISIS).

### 3. War must be undertaken as a last resort

I can see no reason to believe that Trump had exhausted all other plausibly
fruitful courses of action prior to killing Soleimani, an act which
dramatically escalated the situation and could easily have lead to war.

### 4. War must be undertaken by a legitimate authority

Trump does have legal standing to undertake small-scale military actions without
Congressional approval. However, the significance and danger of this particular
action make it preferable that he obtain more support than he did.

Furthermore, the fact that so many of our global allies have condemned the
killing undermines his authority in this case. The President's military actions
should always be undertaken with the understanding that they will be agreeable
to our allies, even if we do not consult them first. Trump had no good reason to
believe this.

### Did Trump have Just Cause?

**Probably not.** If there really was strong evidence of a very serious,
immanent attack, then maybe. But given the posturing we've seen from the Trump
administration over the last few days, that seems extremely unlikely.

## Question 2: Did President Trump commit an act of terrorism on Twitter?

**Yes.**

I understand that this question will strike some as ludicrous. And, admittedly,
the paradigm cases of terrorism (plane hijackings, bus bombings, etc) look
nothing like the actions that I will be criticizing.

However, the apparent dissimilarity is only at the surface level. Once we have
an adequate understanding of what makes terrorism terrorism, and what makes
terrorism especially bad, I will seek to demonstrate that Trump's recent actions
are fundamentally indefensible.

### Defining Terrorism

As with [Just War Theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/), an awful lot
has been written about the nature of
[terrorism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/terrorism/).

For my purposes, I will adopt the following definition:

**Terrorism is coercion by threat or use of force directed at non-combatants in
order to achieve a political goal.**

Since the principles governing Just Means strictly forbid the direct targeting of
non-combatants, all forms of terrorism are forbidden by JWT.

### The Offending Tweet

> Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for
our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an
American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had
killed over his lifetime, including recently hundreds of Iranian protesters. He
was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other
locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as
a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have
targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran
many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran &  the Iranian
culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY
HARD. The USA wants no more threats!
[@realDonaldTrump, Jan 4](
  https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1213593975732527112)

Assuming that Trump had Just Cause for military action, his threat to hit
Iranian targets "VERY FAST AND VERY HARD", needn't be a problem. Sometimes the
best way to minimize the overall harm caused by warfare is to rapidly overpower
the enemy.

**The real problem is that Trump threatened to hit targets important to "the
Iranian culture"**.

We don't know exactly which 52 targets Trump actually had in mind. What we do
know is [how the global community interpreted this](
https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/01/05/iranians-flood-twitter-photos-favorite-cultural-sites-trump-threatens-them):
as a direct threat on cherished, non-military, cultural sites.

Admittedly, the maximally charitable reading of Trump's tweet might assume that
all 52 sites were legitimate military targets, that also happened to have
significant cultural value. But once the outrage started to pour in, Trump did
not clarify his intent in this way.

Instead, he doubled down:

>They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our
people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re
not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way.

Like it or not, President Trump, it really does work that way.

Targeting a cultural site serves no legitimate military purpose. It is designed
to create fear in the populace for political ends. It is an act of terrorism.

Furthermore, as the definition above makes clear, the actual use of force is not
necessary for an act to be an instance of terrorism. The threat of such force is
sufficient. We know this is true because hostage situations in which no act
of violence ever occurs still count as acts of terrorism.

It takes very little imagination to see how Trump's threat is terroristic.
Simply imagine a case in which the United States were on the receiving end of a
comparable threat. If ISIS made a credible threat to blow up the Statue of
Liberty, this certainly would be labeled as terrorism, and offered as
justification for pre-emptive military action to prevent it.


## The Retraction

Thankfully, Trump did not attempt to carry out his threat.

If he had, I am fairly confident that someone in the chain of command would have
refused to follow the order, since [international and US law](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/05/us-trump-threatens-war-crimes-against-iran) both clearly forbid the targeting of cultural
sights.

Someone seems to have successfully explained this to Trump because he did
(half-heartedly) retract his threat a few days later:

> And you know what, if that’s what the law is, I like to obey the law. But think of it — they kill our people. They blow up our people, then we have to be gentle with their cultural institutions. But I’m okay with it. It’s okay with me.


# Conclusion

Every Islamic terrorist organization on the planet drives recruitment by
fueling fear of the United States. Fear that our country is out to destroy Islam
itself. Trump's terroristic threat to destroy Iranian cultural sights confirms
this suspicion, and now serves as public record that he has little to no
personal concern for critical constraints on the methods of warfare.

In my view, this fundamentally disqualifies him as a politically legitimate
leader. Those who support Republican policies should throw Trump under the bus
and do whatever they can to distance themselves from his morally bankrupt
disregard for the ethics of warfare.
