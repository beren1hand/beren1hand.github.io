# The Scale

- __A's:__ Every one of these is solid. Worth watching more than once. Some are masterpieces.
- __B's:__ Flawed, but still worth watching. Maybe even rewatching.
- __C's:__ Might be worth watching. But only once. And you might regret it.
- __D's:__ Just bad. Don't bother.
- __F's:__ Actively painful. Only worth watching ironically.
