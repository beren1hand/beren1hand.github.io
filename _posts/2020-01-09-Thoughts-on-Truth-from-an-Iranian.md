# Some Context

Many of you have noticed that I have been much louder than usual over the past
several days regarding my criticism of President Trump. It's no secret that I
have always been opposed to Trump as a politician, but the events of this past
weekend were, in my view, of a radically different kind. This post is my attempt
to clarify what changed.

# Just War Theory

I am a staunch advocate of Just War Theory. In brief, there are times when it is
morally permissible to fight a war, but there are very strict rules in place
that govern *when* and *how* war may be fought.
