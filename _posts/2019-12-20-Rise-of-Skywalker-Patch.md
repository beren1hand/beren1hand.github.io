# The Rise of Skywalker - Patched

What I wish we'd seen...

- Kylo goes full on Dark Side, but has no mentor, so he parallels the journey of Luke and seeks out the first Sith temple based on stuff he found in Snoke’s belongings
  - When he arrives, he discovers that Snoke had somehow resurrected Palpatine, and was drawing power away from him using torture
    - Thus, Palpatine could exist, and serve as the big baddie without being in control of everything
    - Palpatine as an actual victim would be interesting
    - No comically gigantic fleet of Death Star Destroyers. The threat is the Dark Side itself
- Rey gets trained by Luke and Yoda and collectively they question the ways of the Jedi
  - Why are they anti-love?
  - Isn’t the Dark Side important?
    - After all, Luke defeats Vader using the Dark Side (anger), but isn’t overcome by it
    - Rey’s meditation on the island
        - Warm vs Cold
        - Life, Death, Rebirth
        - More like Yin/Yang than Good/Evil  
  - Turns out, the Good isn’t Light or Dark, it’s Balance
- Rey goes to talk to Maz who tells her to seek out Bendu
  - He teaches her about the origins of Sith and Jedi and encourages her to start a new order of Grey Force users
  - The Force connection between Rey and Kylo works just like it did in the movie (which was neat)
    - Using it, Rey and Kylo teach each other, and discover the deeper nature of the Force
    - They beat Palpatine, get married, and lead the New Order together as a balanced pair
