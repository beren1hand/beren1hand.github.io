title: "Freedom & Foreknowledge"
description: "The apparent conflict between human freedom and divine foreknowledge"
---

The Problem:

```
A) God is omniscient
B) Humans are significantly free (SF)
1) SF → The future is open (OF)
2) OF → The future cannot be known with certainty (~KC)
3) ~KC → God is not omniscient
```
Possible Solutions:

```
~1) Compatibilism
~2a) Atemporalism
~2b) Middle Knowledge
~3) Open Theism
```
